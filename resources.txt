Feature Advices for Image Description:

SIFT(The Scale Invariant Feature Transform)is a descriptor describes the local shape of a region using edge orientation histograms. The gradient of an image is shift-invariant: tak- ing the derivative cancels out offsets . Under light intensity changes, i.e. a scaling of the intensity chan- nel, the gradient direction and the relative gradient magni- tude remain the same. Because the SIFT descriptor is nor- malized, the gradient magnitude changes have no effect on the final descriptor. Light color changes have no effect on the descriptor because the input image is converted to gray- scale, after which the intensity scale-invariance argument applies.
Typical Usage   
For set of database images: 
1. Compute SIFT features 
2. Save descriptors to database 
For query image: 
1. Compute SIFT features
2. For each descriptor: 
      • Find a match 
3. Verify matches 
      • Geometry 
      • Hough transform
      
RGB histogram The RGB histogram is a combination of
three 1-D histograms based on the R, G and B channels of
the RGB color space. This histogram possesses no invari-
ance properties.
Sharpness
Clearly distinguishable objects under friendly weather
conditions are expected to have sharp edges with large
contrast differences. it is used to determine the sharpness of the test
images. It is based on an average determination of the sobel
gradient magnitude


Frameworks:

Caffee:
Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is faster than other frameworks such as tensorflow. It is especially used for image classification. Also more understandable. : Caffe already powers academic research projects, startup prototypes, and even large-scale industrial applications in vision, speech, and multimedia.

Tensorflow:
Tensorflow is most powerful library for deep learning. But it is slower than caffee. and to undarstand and to implement is so hard. It is used widely area: speech recognition, natural language processing, image and video recognition, data mining etc.

Keras
Library for tensorflow. It uses neural network for classification.
